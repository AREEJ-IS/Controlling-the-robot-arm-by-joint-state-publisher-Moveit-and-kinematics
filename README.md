## step1: Step 1: Create a ROS Workspace (Catkin)

````
mkdir catkin_ws
````
then you can go inside your new folder:
````
cd catkin_ws
````
then we are going to create a source (make sure it it exactly src inside thr catkin work space)
````
mkdir src
````

now make sure that you are inside the catkin_ws folder (not inside the src folder) then we can start to compile by running the command :
````
catkin_make
````
